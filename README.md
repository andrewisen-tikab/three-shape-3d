# three-shape-3d

A generic geometric shape object (line, area, volume) for three.js

It's an all-in-one solution for creating and manipulating geometric shapes in three.js.

It's a wrapper around three.js geometry and mesh objects, and provides a simple API for creating and manipulating shapes.

You can create a shape from a set of points and build either a:

-   line
-   area
-   volume

## Installation
